1. Unit tests via SphereTestHarness
   - PASS Immediate cursor appearance
   - PASS Post-target delay with animations

   - PASS No fizzle with disallowed triggers

2. Integration tests
   - PASS Basic spell cast flow
   - PASS Movement during targeting

   - PASS Damage during casting
   - PASS Multiple spell replacement scenarios

3. Performance verification
   - PASS Build time: 10.2 seconds
   - PASS Test execution: 5.87 seconds (189/189 passing)
   - PASS No performance regression
   - PASS Timing accuracy verified

### Phase 3: Combat Action Hierarchy [PENDING]

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days

**Planned Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement spell cast action cancellation
- [ ] Implement weapon swing action cancellation
- [ ] Implement bandage action cancellation
- [ ] Implement wand action cancellation
- [ ] Verify potion action does not cancel
- [ ] Test full cancellation hierarchy

**Action Cancellation Priority:**
1. Spell Cast -> Cancels pending swing
2. Weapon Swing -> Cancels active spell
3. Bandage Use -> Cancels both swing and spell
4. Wand Use -> Cancels both, executes instantly
5. Potion Use -> Cancels nothing

**Key Files to Modify:**
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Weapons/BaseWeapon.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Skill Items/Magical/Misc/Bandage.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Skill Items/Magical/BaseWand.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Food/BasePotion.cs

---

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization [PENDING]

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days

**Planned Optimizations:**
- [ ] Implement object pooling for SphereCombatState
- [ ] Reduce memory allocations (target 40-60% GC reduction)
- [ ] Optimize hot paths (target 20-30% CPU reduction)
- [ ] Reduce string allocations
- [ ] Eliminate LINQ from hot paths
- [ ] Benchmark against Phase 0 baseline

**Target Metrics:**
- Memory: 40-60% reduction in GC pressure
- CPU: 20-30% reduction in hot paths
- Latency: 15-25% improvement in combat response
- Scalability: Support 30-50% more concurrent players

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation [PENDING]

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days

**Validation Tests:**
- [ ] Timer independence verification
- [ ] Action cancellation matrix validation
- [ ] Movement during cast confirmation
- [ ] Damage timing verification
- [ ] 50v50 PvP stress test (72 hours)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against Phase 0
- [ ] Unit tests for all Sphere rules

**Success Criteria:**
- All automated tests passing
- No crashes during stress testing
- Performance targets met or exceeded
- Zero combat-related issues
