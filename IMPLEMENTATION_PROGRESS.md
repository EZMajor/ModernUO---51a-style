### Phase 1: Core Timer Independence [COMPLETE]

**Start Date:** 10/29/2025 12:05 PM  
**Completion Date:** 10/29/2025 1:00 PM  
**Duration:** ~1 hour

**Tasks Completed:**
- [x] Integrate Mobile.cs with SphereCombatState
- [x] Verify timer independence implementation
- [x] Confirm NextCombatTime tracking per mobile
- [x] Remove namespace reference errors
- [x] Build all 7 projects successfully
- [x] Establish performance baseline

**Deliverables:**

2. All 7 projects build without errors
3. Performance baseline established
4. Professional documentation standards applied
5. Phase 1 Completion Report generated

**Result:** Independent timer system operational, baseline established

---

### Phase 2: Complete Spellcasting Integration [NEXT]

**Estimated Start Date:** 10/29/2025  
**Estimated Completion Date:** Est. 11/01/2025  
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days

**Planned Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement immediate target cursor on cast initiation
- [ ] Implement cast delay between target selection and effect
- [ ] Remove post-cast recovery delays
- [ ] Implement mana deduction at target confirmation (not cast start)
- [ ] Verify BlocksMovement returns false during casting
- [ ] Confirm movement does NOT cause fizzle
- [ ] Implement fizzle trigger rules
- [ ] Verify fizzle does NOT trigger on non-specified actions

**Key Files to Modify:**
- Projects/UOContent/Spells/Base/Spell.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Spells/Base/SpellTarget.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Spells/Base/SpellHelper.cs

**Objectives:**
1. Spell casting flow matches Sphere 0.51a behavior
2. Movement during casting allowed without fizzle
3. Fizzle triggers only on: spell cast, bandage, wand, paralyzed, death
4. No fizzle on: movement, damage, potions, equip

---

### Phase 3: Combat Action Hierarchy [PENDING]

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days

**Planned Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement spell cast action cancellation
- [ ] Implement weapon swing action cancellation
- [ ] Implement bandage action cancellation
- [ ] Implement wand action cancellation
- [ ] Verify potion action does not cancel
- [ ] Test full cancellation hierarchy

**Action Cancellation Priority:**
1. Spell Cast -> Cancels pending swing
2. Weapon Swing -> Cancels active spell
3. Bandage Use -> Cancels both swing and spell
4. Wand Use -> Cancels both, executes instantly
5. Potion Use -> Cancels nothing

**Key Files to Modify:**
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Weapons/BaseWeapon.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Skill Items/Magical/Misc/Bandage.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Skill Items/Magical/BaseWand.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Food/BasePotion.cs

---

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization [PENDING]

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days

**Planned Optimizations:**
- [ ] Implement object pooling for SphereCombatState
- [ ] Reduce memory allocations (target 40-60% GC reduction)
- [ ] Optimize hot paths (target 20-30% CPU reduction)
- [ ] Reduce string allocations
- [ ] Eliminate LINQ from hot paths
- [ ] Benchmark against Phase 0 baseline

**Target Metrics:**
- Memory: 40-60% reduction in GC pressure
- CPU: 20-30% reduction in hot paths
- Latency: 15-25% improvement in combat response
- Scalability: Support 30-50% more concurrent players

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation [PENDING]

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days

**Validation Tests:**
- [ ] Timer independence verification
- [ ] Action cancellation matrix validation
- [ ] Movement during cast confirmation
- [ ] Damage timing verification
- [ ] 50v50 PvP stress test (72 hours)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against Phase 0
- [ ] Unit tests for all Sphere rules

**Success Criteria:**
- All automated tests passing
- No crashes during stress testing
- Performance targets met or exceeded
- Zero combat-related issues

- [MITIGATED] Documentation gaps - Professional standards applied

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Comprehensive testing framework in place
2. Rollback system ready for any critical issues
3. Configuration toggles allow feature control
4. Git history provides recovery points
5. Professional documentation maintained

- [x] Baseline metrics established

### Required for Success:
- Independent timer system operational (Phase 1 - COMPLETE)
- Test harness ready (Phase 0 - COMPLETE)
- Rollback system active (Phase 0 - COMPLETE)
- Professional documentation standards (APPLIED)
