**Planning Complete:** 10/29/2025 2:32 PM  
**Estimated Completion Date:** Est. 11/01/2025  
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days

#### Phase 2 Planning Summary (COMPLETE):

Architecture analysis identified:

**SpellTarget.cs Status: [COMPLETE]**
- Immediate target cursor (no pre-cast delay): Implemented
- Post-target delay with animations: Implemented
- Spell replacement logic: Implemented
- Hand clearing and casting animations: Implemented
- Timer.StartTimer for delayed effect: Implemented

**Spell.cs Status: [PARTIAL]**
- Fields for post-target delay: Present
- Fields for spell replacement: Present
- Sphere-style conditionals: Present
- Mana deduction timing: Needs completion
- Restricted fizzle triggers: Needs implementation

**SphereSpellHelper.cs Status: [COMPLETE]**
- Supporting methods: All present
- Movement blocking checks: Implemented
- Cast validation: Implemented

#### Planned Tasks:

- [ ] Implement immediate target cursor on cast initiation
- [ ] Implement cast delay between target selection and effect
- [ ] Move post-cast recovery delays handling
- [ ] Implement mana deduction at target confirmation (not cast start)
- [ ] Verify BlocksMovement returns false during casting
- [ ] Confirm movement does NOT cause fizzle
- [ ] Implement fizzle trigger rules (restricted triggers only)
- [ ] Verify fizzle does NOT trigger on non-specified actions

**Key Files to Modify:**
- Projects/UOContent/Spells/Base/Spell.cs (Mana timing, fizzle triggers)
- Projects/UOContent/Spells/Base/SpellTarget.cs (Verification & testing)
- Projects/UOContent/Systems/Combat/SphereStyle/SphereConfig.cs (Config validation)

**Objectives:**
1. Spell casting flow matches Sphere 0.51a behavior
2. Movement during casting allowed without fizzle
3. Fizzle triggers only on: spell cast, bandage, wand, paralyzed, death
4. No fizzle on: movement, damage, potions, equip

#### Testing Requirements:

1. Unit tests via SphereTestHarness
   - Immediate cursor appearance
   - Post-target delay with animations
   - Mana deduction timing
   - Spell replacement on target selection
   - Fizzle with restricted triggers
   - No fizzle with disallowed triggers

2. Integration tests
   - Basic spell cast flow
   - Movement during targeting
   - Movement during post-target delay
   - Damage during casting
   - Multiple spell replacement scenarios

3. Performance benchmarking
   - Compare vs Phase 1 baseline
   - No performance regression
   - Timing accuracy verification

---

### Phase 3: Combat Action Hierarchy [PENDING]

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days

**Planned Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement spell cast action cancellation
- [ ] Implement weapon swing action cancellation
- [ ] Implement bandage action cancellation
- [ ] Implement wand action cancellation
- [ ] Verify potion action does not cancel
- [ ] Test full cancellation hierarchy

**Action Cancellation Priority:**
1. Spell Cast -> Cancels pending swing
2. Weapon Swing -> Cancels active spell
3. Bandage Use -> Cancels both swing and spell
4. Wand Use -> Cancels both, executes instantly
5. Potion Use -> Cancels nothing

**Key Files to Modify:**
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Weapons/BaseWeapon.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Skill Items/Magical/Misc/Bandage.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Skill Items/Magical/BaseWand.cs
- Projects/UOContent/Items/Food/BasePotion.cs

---

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization [PENDING]

**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 days

**Planned Optimizations:**
- [ ] Implement object pooling for SphereCombatState
- [ ] Reduce memory allocations (target 40-60% GC reduction)
- [ ] Optimize hot paths (target 20-30% CPU reduction)
- [ ] Reduce string allocations
- [ ] Eliminate LINQ from hot paths
- [ ] Benchmark against Phase 0 baseline

**Target Metrics:**
- Memory: 40-60% reduction in GC pressure
- CPU: 20-30% reduction in hot paths
- Latency: 15-25% improvement in combat response
- Scalability: Support 30-50% more concurrent players

---

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation [PENDING]

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 days

**Validation Tests:**
- [ ] Timer independence verification
- [ ] Action cancellation matrix validation
- [ ] Movement during cast confirmation
- [ ] Damage timing verification
- [ ] 50v50 PvP stress test (72 hours)
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against Phase 0
- [ ] Unit tests for all Sphere rules

**Success Criteria:**
- All automated tests passing
- No crashes during stress testing
- Performance targets met or exceeded
- Zero combat-related issues

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks: MINIMAL

- [MITIGATED] Compilation errors - All projects build successfully
- [MITIGATED] Performance regression - Baseline established for comparison
- [MITIGATED] Breaking changes - Rollback system ready for emergency revert
- [MITIGATED] Documentation gaps - Professional standards applied

### Phase 2 Risks:

- [RISK] Mana deduction timing - Complex timing logic, requires careful testing
- [MITIGATION] Comprehensive testing via SphereTestHarness
- [MITIGATION] Spell replacement already partially implemented
- [MITIGATION] Architecture already in place

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Comprehensive testing framework in place
2. Rollback system ready for any critical issues
3. Configuration toggles allow feature control
4. Git history provides recovery points
5. Professional documentation maintained
