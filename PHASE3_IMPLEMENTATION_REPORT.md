# Phase 3 Implementation Report: Combat Action Hierarchy

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 3 implementation has commenced. The project builds successfully with no compilation errors. Phase 3 implements the Sphere 0.51a action cancellation hierarchy where spell casts, weapon swings, bandages, and wands cancel each other in priority order.

## Build Status

[PASS] All 7 projects compile successfully
[PASS] No compilation errors or warnings
[PASS] Build time: 2.7 seconds
[PASS] Ready for implementation modifications

## Implementation Plan

### Action Cancellation Hierarchy (Implementation Order)

1. **Spell Cast** (Already Implemented - Phase 2)
   - Cancels pending swing + active spell
   - Configuration: SpellCancelSwing
   - Status: [COMPLETE]

2. **Weapon Swing Cancellation** (Phase 3 - Priority 1)
   - File: BaseWeapon.cs
   - Action: Implement SwingCancelSpell in OnSwing()
   - Status: [PENDING]

3. **Bandage Action Cancellation** (Phase 3 - Priority 2)
   - File: Bandage.cs
   - Action: Implement swing + spell cancellation in OnUse()
   - Status: [PENDING]

4. **Wand Action Cancellation** (Phase 3 - Priority 3)
   - File: BaseWand.cs
   - Action: Implement swing + spell cancellation + instant execution
   - Status: [PENDING]

5. **Potion Verification** (Phase 3 - Priority 4)
   - File: BasePotion.cs
   - Action: Verify no action cancellation
   - Status: [PENDING]

## Next Steps

1. Analyze BaseWeapon.cs OnSwing() method for spell cancellation implementation
2. Analyze Bandage.cs OnUse() method for action cancellation
3. Analyze BaseWand.cs for wand implementation
4. Implement each action cancellation step
5. Create and run Phase 3 test cases
6. Benchmark and validate performance
7. Document Phase 3 completion
