## Implementation Status

### What Was Already Implemented

#### 1. Spell.cs - Complete Implementation 
**Status:** Fully functional, no modifications needed

**Implemented Features:**
- Mana deduction timing (Cast method skips check in immediate target mode)
- Dual mana deduction system (`_pendingManaDeduction` field)
- Restricted fizzle triggers in Disturb() method
- Movement validation (BlocksMovement property)
- Proper error messages for insufficient mana
- Sphere-style conditionals throughout

**Key Code Sections:**
- `Cast()` method (line ~641): Skips mana check when `sphereImmediateTargetMode` enabled
- `CheckSequence()` method: Implements dual mana deduction with partial/remaining split
- `Disturb()` method (line ~465): Validates fizzle against restricted triggers
- `OnCasterHurt()` method: Respects `RestrictedFizzleTriggers` and `DamageBasedFizzle` configs

#### 2. SpellTarget.cs - Complete Implementation 
**Status:** Fully functional, all post-target delay mechanics working

**Implemented Features:**
- Immediate cursor on cast start (no pre-cast delay)
- Post-target delay with animations and mantra
- Spell replacement logic with `HasSelectedTarget` tracking
- Hand clearing and casting animations during post-target phase
- Timer.StartTimer() for delayed effect execution
- Proper interruption handling

**Key Code Sections:**
- `OnTarget()` method: Full post-target delay implementation (line ~42)
- Timer callback: Executes spell effect after delay (line ~108)
- `OnTargetFinish()` method: Prevents early sequence finish when using delays

#### 3. SphereSpellHelper.cs - Complete Implementation 
**Status:** All supporting methods fully functional

**Implemented Methods:**
- `ValidateCast()`: Sphere-specific cast validation
- `OnCastBegin()`: Spell initiation with swing/bandage cancellation
- `OnCastComplete()`: Spell completion tracking
- `OnEnterCastDelay()`: Post-target phase tracking
- `CheckBlocksMovement()`: Movement permission logic
- `GetCastRecovery()`: Optional post-cast recovery removal
- `CheckManaDeduction()`: Timing logic for mana deduction
- `CheckDamageDisturb()`: Damage-based fizzle configuration

## Phase 2 Implementation Details

### Mana Deduction Timing

**How It Works:**
1. **Cast Initiation:** `Cast()` method called
   - In Sphere immediate target mode: **skip mana check** (line ~695)
   - In non-Sphere mode: check mana as normal
2. **Target Selection:** Player selects target (SpellTarget.OnTarget called)
   - Stores target coordinates
3. **CheckSequence():** Post-target confirmation
   - Performs mana deduction at this point (line ~1075)
   - Partial mana (configurable %) deducted first
   - Remaining mana deducted on successful cast
   - Full mana deducted on fizzle

**Configuration Toggles:**
- `ImmediateSpellTarget`: Enable immediate cursor
- `CastDelayAfterTarget`: Enable post-target delay
- `TargetManaDeduction`: Enable target confirmation mana check

### Restricted Fizzle Triggers

**Sphere 0.51a Rules Implemented:**

**Fizzle ON (causes resource consumption):**
- [x] NewCast (new spell interrupts active spell)
- [x] Kill (caster dies)

**Fizzle OFF (no resource consumption):**
- [x] Movement (allowed, doesn't interrupt)
- [x] Hurt (damage taken, doesn't interrupt)
- [x] EquipRequest (equipment changes, doesn't interrupt)
- [x] UseRequest (bandage/potion use, doesn't interrupt)

**Implementation:** `Disturb()` method (line ~465-475) checks `RestrictedFizzleTriggers` config and only allows fizzle on specific action types.

### Movement During Casting

**How It Works:**
1. **Targeting Phase:** Player shows cursor, movement allowed
   - `BlocksMovement` returns false (line ~119)
   - Movement doesn't fizzle spell
   - No error message shown
2. **Post-Target Delay Phase:** Animations play, movement allowed
   - `BlocksMovement` still returns false
   - Movement doesn't cancel spell effect

**Configuration Toggles:**
- `AllowMovementDuringCast`: Enable movement permission
- `CheckBlocksMovement()`: Helper validates movement rules

## Configuration Verification

All configuration toggles verified in SphereConfig.cs:

```csharp
EnableSphereStyle = true              // Master enable
ImmediateSpellTarget = true           // Immediate cursor
CastDelayAfterTarget = true           // Post-target delay
AllowMovementDuringCast = true        // Movement allowed
RemovePostCastRecovery = true         // No recovery delay
TargetManaDeduction = true            // Mana at confirmation
RestrictedFizzleTriggers = true       // Restrict fizzle actions
DamageBasedFizzle = false             // No damage fizzle
SpellCancelSwing = true               // Spell cancels swing
SwingCancelSpell = true               // Swing cancels spell
BandageCancelActions = true           // Bandage cancels both
IndependentTimers = true              // Separate swing/spell timers
```
