# Sphere 0.51a Combat System Implementation for ModernUO

## Professional Standards

IMPORTANT: This is a professional project. Maintain the following standards:
- NO emojis or special Unicode characters in documentation
- Use text labels for status: [COMPLETE], [PENDING], [NEXT], [IN PROGRESS]
- Use [PASS] and [FAIL] for test results
- Keep all documentation professional and clear
- Use checkboxes [x] and [ ] only in todo lists

## Project Overview

This document serves as the master reference for the Sphere 0.51a combat system implementation in ModernUO. It consolidates all planning documents, implementation status, and provides clear direction for continuing the work.

### Objectives

- Implement complete Sphere 0.51a combat mechanics in ModernUO
- Maintain correctness as the primary goal, optimization as secondary
- Create foundation for 30-50% scalability improvement
- Achieve 40-60% reduction in GC pressure
- Support 15-25% improvement in combat response latency

### Key Principle

**Independent Timer Systems with No Global Recovery Delays** - allowing fluid combat flow as per original Sphere behavior.

## Core Sphere 51a Rules Reference

### Combat Flow (From ModernUo to Sphere Data compilation)

| Area | Sphere Behavior |
|------|-----------------|
| Global Recovery | Removed - no shared delays |
| Swing vs Cast | Separate independent timers |
| Cast vs Swing | Spell cancels swing on cast start |
| Movement | Allowed during casting (no lock) |
| Damage Timing | Applied immediately on hit |
| Spell Fizzle | Restricted to defined actions only |
| Bandage | Independent timer, cancels swing/cast |
| Wands | Instant-cast behavior |
| Ranged vs Melee | Unified timing and cancel behavior |
| Queued Actions | Disabled - restart on interrupt |
| Timer Control | Fully independent per system |

5. Potion Use -> Cancels nothing

**Key Files to Modify:**
- `Projects/UOContent/Items/Weapons/BaseWeapon.cs` (already has edits)
- `Projects/UOContent/Items/Skill Items/Magical/Misc/Bandage.cs`

## How to Continue Implementation

### Resuming Phase 1 (Core Timer Independence):

1. **Examine Mobile.cs** to understand current timer logic
2. **Create SphereCombatState instance** for each Mobile
3. **Modify Mobile.OnThink** to use independent timers
4. **Remove global recovery** delay logic
5. **Run benchmarks** with `SphereBenchmarks.StartTimer()`
6. **Run tests** with `SphereTestHarness.RunAllTests()`

### Testing Framework Usage:

```csharp
// Run all tests
SphereTestHarness.RunAllTests();

// Check individual results
var results = SphereTestHarness.TestResults;
if (SphereTestHarness.TestsFailed > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Tests failed!");
}

// Run benchmarks
using (var timer = SphereBenchmarks.StartTimer("my-operation"))
{
    // Code to benchmark
}

// Print reports
SphereBenchmarks.PrintReport();
SphereTestHarness.PrintReport();
```

### Rollback Procedures:

```csharp
// Emergency rollback to ModernUO defaults
SphereRollback.ExecuteRollback("Critical issue detected");

// Restore Sphere combat
SphereRollback.RestoreSphereCombat("Issue resolved");

// Check status
Console.WriteLine(SphereRollback.GetStatus());
```
