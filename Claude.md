## Project Overview

This document serves as the master reference for the Sphere 0.51a combat system implementation in ModernUO. It consolidates all planning documents, implementation status, and provides clear direction for continuing the work.

### Objectives

- Implement complete Sphere 0.51a combat mechanics in ModernUO
- Maintain correctness as the primary goal, optimization as secondary
- Create foundation for 30-50% scalability improvement
- Achieve 40-60% reduction in GC pressure
- Support 15-25% improvement in combat response latency

### Key Principle

**Independent Timer Systems with No Global Recovery Delays** - allowing fluid combat flow as per original Sphere behavior.

   - Modified OnSwing() in BaseWeapon.cs
   - Cancels active spell when SwingCancelSpell enabled
   - Integrated with Sphere state management

2. [PASS] Bandage Action Cancellation
   - Verified existing implementation in Bandage.cs
   - Bandage use cancels active spell when BandageCancelActions enabled
   - Already properly integrated

3. [PASS] Wand Action Cancellation
   - Modified OnDoubleClick() in BaseWand.cs
   - Cancels active spell when WandCancelActions enabled
   - Swing cancellation handled via Sphere state

4. [PASS] Potion Verification
   - Confirmed BasePotion.cs has no action cancellation code
   - Potions do not cancel swing or spell per Sphere 0.51a rules
   - Behavior verified correct

#### Action Cancellation Hierarchy:

| Priority | Action | Cancels | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Spell Cast | Pending swing + active spell | [COMPLETE] |
| 2 | Weapon Swing | Active spell | [COMPLETE] |
| 3 | Bandage Use | Swing + spell | [COMPLETE] |
| 4 | Wand Use | Swing + spell | [COMPLETE] |
| 5 | Potion Use | Nothing | [COMPLETE] |

#### Compilation Status:

### [COMPLETE] PHASE 3.5: Double Fizzle Bug Fix

**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Completed:** 10/29/2025 7:01 PM

#### Issue Resolution:

Fixed double fizzle effect display bug when casting spells from spellbooks in Sphere immediate target mode. When a spell was interrupted by selecting the target of another spell, the fizzle effect (message, particles, sound) was displayed twice.

#### Root Cause:

The DoFizzle() method in Spell.cs could be called multiple times on the same spell instance without protection. In SpellTarget.OnTarget(), when a new spell's target is selected, it calls Disturb() on the previously active spell, which triggers DoFizzle(). Without a guard mechanism, the method had no protection against being called again if the spell was disturbed a second time.

#### Implementation:

1. Added `_hasFizzled` flag to Spell class to track fizzle state
2. Modified DoFizzle() to check flag before executing:
   - If already fizzled, returns immediately without showing effect
   - If first fizzle, sets flag and displays message/particles/sound

#### Files Modified:

- Projects/UOContent/Spells/Base/Spell.cs (2 changes)
  - Added private bool _hasFizzled field
  - Added guard check in DoFizzle() method

#### Compilation Status:

- [PASS] All 7 projects compile successfully
- [PASS] No compilation errors or warnings

Status: [PASS] Phase 3.5 double fizzle fix complete and operational
