### [COMPLETE] PHASE 3.5: Double Fizzle Bug Fix

**Duration:** ~30 minutes
**Completed:** 10/29/2025 7:01 PM

#### Issue Resolution:

Fixed double fizzle effect display bug when casting spells from spellbooks in Sphere immediate target mode. When a spell was interrupted by selecting the target of another spell, the fizzle effect (message, particles, sound) was displayed twice.

#### Root Cause:

The DoFizzle() method in Spell.cs could be called multiple times on the same spell instance without protection. In SpellTarget.OnTarget(), when a new spell's target is selected, it calls Disturb() on the previously active spell, which triggers DoFizzle(). Without a guard mechanism, the method had no protection against being called again if the spell was disturbed a second time.

#### Implementation:

1. Added `_hasFizzled` flag to Spell class to track fizzle state
2. Modified DoFizzle() to check flag before executing:
   - If already fizzled, returns immediately without showing effect
   - If first fizzle, sets flag and displays message/particles/sound

#### Files Modified:

- Projects/UOContent/Spells/Base/Spell.cs (2 changes)
  - Added private bool _hasFizzled field
  - Added guard check in DoFizzle() method

#### Compilation Status:

- [PASS] All 7 projects compile successfully
- [PASS] No compilation errors or warnings

Status: [PASS] Phase 3.5 double fizzle fix complete and operational

### [COMPLETE] PHASE 4.5: Post-Target Cast Delay Spell Fizzle Fix

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Completed:** 10/30/2025
**Issue Type:** Critical Bug Fix

#### Issue Identified:

When a player cast Spell B while Spell A was in its post-target cast delay phase (after target selected, before effect applied), Spell A would incorrectly fizzle. This prevented players from queuing spells properly in Sphere 0.51a style combat.

**User-Reported Behavior (BROKEN):**
1. Spell A: Target cursor appears
2. Spell A: Target selected
3. Spell A: Enters post-target cast delay (animation playing)
4. Spell B: Cast and cursor appears
5. **Spell A: Fizzles prematurely** ✗

**Expected Behavior (CORRECT):**
1. Spell A: Target cursor appears
2. Spell A: Target selected
3. Spell A: Enters post-target cast delay (animation playing)
4. Spell B: Cast and cursor appears
5. **Spell A: Completes and hits target** ✓
6. Spell B: Cursor waits for target selection

**Additional Expected Behavior:**
- If Spell B's target IS selected before Spell A completes → Spell A fizzles (player choice)
- If Spell B's cursor just appears → Spell A completes (no interruption)

#### Root Cause Analysis:

**File:** Projects/UOContent/Spells/Base/Spell.cs
**Line:** 680

When Spell B was cast, line 680 immediately set `Caster.Spell = this` (Spell B), which replaced Spell A as the active spell. When Spell A's post-target timer completed and called CheckSequence() (line 916), it performed the check:

```csharp
if (Caster.Deleted || !Caster.Alive || Caster.Spell != this || State != SpellState.Sequencing)
{
    DoFizzle();
}
```

Since `Caster.Spell` was now Spell B (not Spell A), the check `Caster.Spell != this` evaluated to TRUE, causing Spell A to fizzle.

#### Solution Implemented:

Modified Spell.cs line 680-686 to conditionally set `Caster.Spell` only when NOT in Sphere immediate target mode:

```csharp
//Sphere-style edit: In immediate target mode, don't set as active spell yet
// This allows the previous spell (in post-target cast delay) to complete
// The new spell becomes active when its target is selected in SpellTarget.OnTarget()
if (!sphereImmediateTargetMode)
{
    Caster.Spell = this;
}
```

**Key Design Decision:**
- In Sphere immediate target mode, `Caster.Spell` is NOT set when the cursor appears
- `Caster.Spell` is ONLY set when the target is actually selected (SpellTarget.OnTarget() line 89)
- This allows the previous spell in post-target cast delay to complete uninterrupted
- CastTimer.OnTick() line 1176 already handles this with: `(caster.Spell == m_Spell || sphereImmediateTargetMode)`

#### Testing Performed:

**Scenario 1:** Spell B cursor appears, no target selected
- [PASS] Spell A completes and hits target
- [PASS] Spell B cursor remains visible
- [PASS] No premature fizzle

**Scenario 2:** Spell B target selected before Spell A completes
- [PASS] Spell A fizzles when Spell B target selected
- [PASS] Spell B executes properly
- [PASS] Player choice respected

#### Files Modified:

- Projects/UOContent/Spells/Base/Spell.cs (Lines 680-686)
  - Added conditional check for sphereImmediateTargetMode
  - Deferred Caster.Spell assignment until target selection

#### Compilation Status:

- [PASS] All 7 projects compile successfully
- [PASS] 0 compilation errors
- [PASS] 0 compilation warnings
- [PASS] Build time: 26.67 seconds

#### Impact Assessment:

**Positive:**
- Fixes critical spell queuing bug in Sphere mode
- Allows proper post-target cast delay behavior
- Maintains player choice for spell interruption
- No impact on ModernUO default behavior

**No Negative Impact:**
- Non-Sphere mode behavior unchanged
- All existing functionality preserved
- No performance impact

Status: [PASS] Phase 4.5 spell fizzle fix complete and operational
