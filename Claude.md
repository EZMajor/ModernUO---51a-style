4. **Post-Target Delay Completion**
   - Verify SpellTarget properly triggers post-target delay
   - Confirm animations and mantra play during post-target phase
   - Verify spell effects execute after delay completes
   - Test with various cast delays (instant, 0.5s, 1.0s, 1.5s)

5. **Configuration Validation & Testing**
   - Verify SphereConfig.ImmediateSpellTarget enables immediate cursor
   - Verify SphereConfig.CastDelayAfterTarget enables post-target delay

#### Testing Strategy:

1. **Unit Tests via SphereTestHarness**
   - Test immediate cursor appearance (casting state initiated)
   - Test post-target delay with animations
   - Test mana deduction at correct timing
   - Test spell replacement on target selection
   - Test fizzle with each restricted trigger
   - Test fizzle NOT occurring with disallowed triggers

2. **Integration Tests**

## How to Continue Implementation

### Phase 2 - Next Steps:

1. **Modify Spell.cs Mana Deduction**
   - Remove mana check from Cast() when Sphere immediate targeting enabled
   - Add mana deduction to CheckSequence() at target confirmation
   - Test with SphereTestHarness

2. **Implement Restricted Fizzle Triggers**
   - Modify Disturb() to only fizzle on specified DisturbType values
   - Update OnCasterHurt() to respect fizzle restrictions
   - Test all trigger scenarios

3. **Validate Movement During Casting**
   - Verify BlocksMovement logic in both phases
   - Test movement in targeting and post-target phases
   - Confirm no fizzle on movement

4. **Run Comprehensive Tests**

   ```

5. **Benchmark Against Baseline**
   ```csharp
   SphereBenchmarks.PrintReport();
   ```

### Testing Framework Usage:

```csharp
// Run all tests
SphereTestHarness.RunAllTests();

// Check individual results
var results = SphereTestHarness.TestResults;
if (SphereTestHarness.TestsFailed > 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Tests failed!");
}

// Run benchmarks
using (var timer = SphereBenchmarks.StartTimer("my-operation"))
{
    // Code to benchmark
}

// Print reports
SphereBenchmarks.PrintReport();
SphereTestHarness.PrintReport();
```

### Rollback Procedures:

```csharp
// Emergency rollback to ModernUO defaults
SphereRollback.ExecuteRollback("Critical issue detected");

// Restore Sphere combat
SphereRollback.RestoreSphereCombat("Issue resolved");

// Check status
Console.WriteLine(SphereRollback.GetStatus());
```
